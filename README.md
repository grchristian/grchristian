# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian

I consider myself a person who has found his passion at an early age, because for as long as I can remember my passion has been computer technologies and I hope one day I can create and innovate in this area, I am currently studying my 4th semester of computer science and technology degree in Mexico City.
